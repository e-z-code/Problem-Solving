BOJ 1867 - Remove Rocks (https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/1867)

There are K rocks on an N X N grid.
In an operation, you can choose a row or a column and remove all rocks on the row or the column.
Determine the minimum number of operations needed to remove all rocks.

# 1. TO GET THE INPUT AND CONSTRUCT A BIPARTITE GRAPH
# Each rock (i, j) is an edge that connects the vertex row[i] and the vertex col[j].
# Then, the problem is equivalent to calculating the size of a minimum vertex cover set. 

grid_size, rock_count = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

    graph[row] = []

for rock in range(rock_count):
    row, col = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    graph[row-1].append(col-1)


# 3. TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM
# According to KÅ‘nig's theorem, the minimum vertex cover set and the maximum matching set have the same size.

row_assigned = [-1 for col in range(grid_size)]
