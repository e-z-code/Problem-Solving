BOJ 17994 - Swap Free (https://www.acmicpc.net/problem/17994)

A set of words is swap-free if there is no way to turn any word in the set into any other word in the set by swapping a single pair of letters.
You are given N words that are all anagrams of each other.
Determine the size of the largest swap-free set.
